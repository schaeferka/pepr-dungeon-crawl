# Pepr Dungeon Crawl

I've been spending a lot of time working with [Pepr](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/pepr) and [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io). Along the way, I ran into [KubeDoom](https://github.com/storax/kubedoom) which inspired me to find a fun way to explore how Pepr interacts with a cluster using validating and mutating webhooks. The result of this exploration was Pepr Dungeon Crawl.
